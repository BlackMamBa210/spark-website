## About this Repository

Among other areas, Phoenix Spark is driving the organization and development of USAF software tools. This involves implementing custom projects, teaching new developers, and collaborating on existing solutions. We are developing our website in this spirit. 

1. The source code is available here: [TravisSpark/spark-website](https://github.com/TravisSpark/spark-website)
2. The language is Jekyll for Ruby
3. The design utilizes [U.S Web Design System UI-Components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) developed by the [GSA's Technology-Transformation-Services] (https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services)
4. It is a fork of [Code.mil](https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil)
5. The [wiki](https://github.com/TravisSpark/spark-website/wiki) provides tutorials on developing and sharing software

## Open Sourcing in the DoD

On June 2, 2016, the U.S Chief Information and Acquisition Officers released a memorandum for the heads of departments and agencies of the federal government: [M-16-21](https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/policy/introduction). This memorandum addressed a Federal Source Code Policy. The goal is to improve the the cost efficiency, mission effectiveness, and consumer experience of government programs. To help implement this policy, the websites [code.gov](https://code.gov) and [code.mil](https://www.code.mil/#/) to address the needs of general federal agencies and the DoD, respectively. 


From the [Code.mil Readme](https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil/blob/master/README.md):

> The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) faces unique challenges in open sourcing its code. Unlike most software projects, Code written by U.S. Federal government employees typically doesn't have copyright protections under U.S. and some international laws. This can make it hard to attach an open source license to our code, and our team here at Defense Digital Service wants to find a solution. 

Join us at Phoenix Spark in developing the Warfighting tools of tomorrow.
