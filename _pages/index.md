  content: “If in peacetime we tell every Airman how to do everything, how can we possibly expect, in wartime, we will suddenly be able to take the initiative and prevail in highly contested combat?” –Secretary Heather Wilson


tagline: Innovations by the Warfighter, for the Warfighter
intro:
  '<p>In January 2016 at Travis Air Force Base, leadership issued a grand challenge: <i>how do we leverage our Airmen’s ingenuity and the technical expertise in Silicon Valley to bring tomorrow’s capabilities to the Warfighter today?</i>  This challenge led to the organic formation of the Travis AFB Innovation Office; a volunteer group built to connect operational experts in the military and problem-solvers from industry, academia, and the Department of Defense (DoD).  These partnerships bolstered existing innovation efforts within the Air Force, created a forum to solve base-level capability gaps, and allowed for the discovery of unknown opportunities, ultimately enhancing mission effectiveness across the enterprise.<p>  
  
  <p>Using an iterative framework, the Travis Innovation Office created a grassroots model capable of responding agilely to the Warfighters’ needs and incorporated the operational experts into the ideation and solution development process.  This model gained the attention of the Air Mobility Command commander who, in April of 2017, signed a charter creating PHOENIX SPARK, a program that empowers grassroots innovation.  As the inaugural PHOENIX SPARK Hub, Travis AFB provides leadership and is the role model for future SPARK programs across the Total Force.  Through continuous organizational learning and inspiring a culture of innovation and empowerment, PHOENIX SPARK will <i>deliver tomorrow’s innovative capabilities to the warfighter today.</i></p>'
